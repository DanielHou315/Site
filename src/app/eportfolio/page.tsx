            <p id="p1-intro">
              As a Michigan engineer, I have set my lifelong journey toward sculpting intelligence for the benefit of our communities. I aspire to build intelligent robotic systems because robotics is the beautiful combination of digitation and reality. Through digital signal processing, commanding and interacting with a tangible moving robot is the most unreal and exciting thing I can ever imagine. Through the power of physical manipulations, robots can become vast empowerment of humans in various forms and can greatly advance the quality of life and productivity of the human race. This is why I aspire to build intelligent robots for the good of our communities and our world.

            <p>
              These ambitious pursuits has its origins in humble beginnings. Through trials of errors, extensive research, and with a daring mind to break set boundaries, I am continuously developing a set of work habits and mentalities customized for future success. Today, as I ardently work to craft artificial intelligence systems that champion accessibility and equity, it is worth reflecting on where my lifelong pursuit of accessibility in artificial intelligence originated.

              Soon, I started on my freshman year at the University of Michigan, fueled by a singular mission: to deepen my knowledge and maximize my commitment within my communities with intelligent systems. At Michigan, I soon realized that sometimes, a mission is all you need to push boundaries and explore realms beyond one&apos;s wildest dreams.

              From those first sparks in a high school robotics competition to the halls of Michigan Engineering, my journey has been transformative.

              From the experience with Spatial Audio Guidance System, I realized the importance of branching out for inspirations. It is exactly a completely unrelated gaming experience that sparked an ideation of a helpful device. With Michigan Engineering Honors seminars, I am aspired to actively meet engineers from different fields and inspire each other to continue to innovate in our respective fields. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Eager to further gain experiences innovating and experimenting for the good of our communities, I look forward to taking the challenge of an extra capstone project where I will have the freedom to research and realize my dreams in the field of robotics, devising robots and algorithms that makes our campus more accessible for minority groups. 
            </p>

            <p>
              As I stand at this juncture, looking both backward at my achievements and forward to the horizon of possibilities, I am reminded of the intrinsic mission of engineering. As I continue to forge ahead, my commitment is unwavering: to innovate with purpose, to create with conscience, and to always remain a student, eager to learn, adapt, and grow as an Michigan Honors Engineer.
