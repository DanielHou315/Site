        Starting Summer 2023, I realized that I experienced an important moment of transition in my life, and for the first time I realized how much I have changed over some period of time. I decided to note this down, and this became my first blog. I will continuously publish blogs on this site, both technical writings, some problem-solving experience documentation, as well as reflections on personal growth or view of recent events. As I continue to expand on this library of blogs, please check out other sections of the site where I document my other works of creation and fruition of learning.
