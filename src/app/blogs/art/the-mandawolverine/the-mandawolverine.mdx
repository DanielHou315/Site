# The Mandawolverine

This is a 1:1 life sized helment of the Mandalorian entirely 3D printed using equipment at the Shapiro Design Lab, where I work as an Intern. 

While I did not design this helmet, the manufacturing of this helmet is a great challenge for me, the machines, and the shop as a whole. To begin with, the helmet is too big to fit in any of the machines in the shop, but too small to fit my head. Therefore, I had to cut the model into four pieces in software and print them separat ely on different machines. I believe the four major parts took about 12+12+16+22=62 hours to print. 

The connection of these pieces are also new for many of us in the shop. I designed a mechanism where I printed many small sticks, and drilled holes at specific connection points in the connecting areas of each component. I then use hot glue and these sticks to attach the parts, and finally use hot glue to seal the gaps between them. However, since hot glue works with a temperature difference, a shrink in volume when cooled down is inevitable, causing significant indentation along the seam. 

To fill in the gaps, we used Bondo for the first time in the shop and explored its properties when working with 3D printed parts and hot glue. After a few weeks of filling and cleaning, the seams are barely visible. 

Finally, it is the first the shop ever used spray-paint. Over many days, I spray-painted this helmet outside my apartment, and with the many layers of paint, it finally looks kind of metallic. 

I wore the helmet on a U-M school bus fron North to Central campus on the weekend before exam week, and the reaction of people are hilarious to watch.
