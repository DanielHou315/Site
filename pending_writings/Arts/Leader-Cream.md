# Leader Cream

The Leader Cream is an imaginary product that Andrew and I designed while reading **Orphan Master's Son** in English IV in high school. It aims at ironically reflect the socity described in the book. 

A detailed analysis: 
- The entire video is told in Korean, but the subtitle is in English. If you understand Korean (which I don't), you will notice that the voiceover has nothing to do with the subtitle, but certain words do coincide (such as the English pronunciation of Trump, and Chinese pronunciation of Comrad Kim Jon Un--金正恩同志), which acts as a "alignment notch" as I call it. This has the effect of alluring the audience (that is, you) into believing that the subtitle is an accurate translation of the voiceover, and will be convinced what the subtitles say is true. What this reflects is the governmental release of information in the society imaged in the novel **Orphan Master's Son**, where false information is spread with a mix of truth so that the general public believes in all the government feeds them. 

- The entire video is filled with passionate voiceovers and claps from large number of military personnels that praises their leader, as described in the book. 

- If you strip down the ad, the product by itself has ridiculous effects that won't work as advertised, and for that impossible effect it is sold at a very high price directly by the government. Not only is this a reflection of the nation-owned planned economy system, but it is also a reflection of how the goernment in the book took resouces out of its own people's hands for the government's (or the leader's in fact) desires. 

Disclaimer: all characters and story plots in the video are imaginary and are not recreation of the real world.
