# WTF is this font? 

You probably have see this font here and there in my website, mainly in title sections. Yes, I desiged this font from ground up. After learning a little bit of history of fonts in printing and computers, we were delegated a task of designing our own font in my Digital Arts I class in high school. Having always appreciated the magical combination of strength and flexibility in Chinese Writings, I did not hesitate to incorporate the beauty of Chinese Writings into English character sets. 

Since I took a class in middle school about handwriting Chinese, I was pleased to recall the specific techniques used to present all the starts and ends and curves of strokes, and after countless experiments and hundreds of final handwriting tries, I gathered together a set of characters that I wrote on paper myself and scanned them with a special machine that eventually generated digital versions of my writings as a font file. I am pleased that this project was my attempt at appreciating and explaining the natural beauty of Chinese Writing Art to a global audience (at the time my schoolmates, and now, through this site, the world). 

While this font is not designed for large chunks of text and it only has capital letters (lower case letters are just shrunk down versions, as you may have noticed), I do see this character set being a piece of beauty in representing a short text like a title. 

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed it.
